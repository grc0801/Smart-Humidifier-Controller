# Smart Humidifier Controller using ATmega328P â€“ KiCAD Simulation + Arduino Firmware

This project simulates a Bluetooth-enabled smart humidifier controller using the ATmega328P microcontroller. It features both manual and wireless control using a push button and HC-05 Bluetooth module. The system also includes status LED output and MOSFET switching for humidifier control.

The schematic and PCB layout were designed using KiCAD and verified with 0 DRC errors. Firmware is written in Arduino IDE and ready for upload via ISP after fabrication.
